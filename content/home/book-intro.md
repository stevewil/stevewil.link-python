Conflict is everywhere. It’s a natural part of the human condition. So of course it exists in the preschool classroom, just as it does in any setting where humans come together. In this book, we want to challenge some common assumptions about conflict, and how it should be handled in preschools. We are calling these assumptions “myths”—because people believe in them deeply, and they are not necessarily true.

### Myth #1: Conflict is misbehavior.

**Reality:** Conflict is normal. It’s not misbehavior. A conflict is just a problem to be solved. The solving process can be creative and cooperative. That process can build social skills while strengthening relationships.

Think about the workplace. Two very capable and conscientious employees disagree about how to handle a project at work. They both feel passionate about their positions. But there is no good guy or bad guy in this scenario. The boss doesn’t need to discipline them, but she may need to assist them with peaceful conflict resolution. She doesn’t arbitrate, which would be to tell them what she thinks they should do. Instead, she mediates, by asking great questions, getting them to talk about how they feel about the conflict, and allowing them to suggest and negotiate solutions. Perhaps they will create a hybrid of their ideas or come up with a third way that is better than either of the ideas they started with.

Think about families. Two sisters disagree about what to do about their aging mother who is no longer able to live in her home. The sisters each live in a different city, and each thinks Mom would be better off near her. Both sisters love Mom—and they love each other. Again, there is no good guy, no bad guy. Despite the strong feelings and competing notions of a good solution, no one is misbehaving. They hire a mediator to help them work things out so that Mom gets the best of care and the sisters’ strong relationship is preserved.

It’s the same with kids. Children’s conflicts can be sudden, noisy and passionate. And because young children have limited self-control, a conflict can quickly lead to unsafe and unacceptable behavior, such as hitting. Teachers often correct the aggressive behavior without addressing the legitimate, everyday conflict that started the whole thing. We think that’s a lost opportunity for valuable social learning.

### Myth #2: The teacher should act as an arbitrator.

**Reality:** Whenever possible, the teacher should act as mediator, assisting the children to resolve their own conflict. Arbitration, a top-down way of resolving conflict, deprives the children of the opportunity to develop a vocabulary for self-expression and the patience and skill to negotiate. With time, there will be buy-in; in other words, children gradually learn that win-win solutions are more satisfactory than squabbling. And yes, kids may eventually come up with a solution that looks a lot like something an adult would suggest, such as taking turns. But it’s the process that got them to that resolution that is so valuable.

### Myth #3: Conflict is a nuisance.

**Reality:** Conflict is the curriculum. Dinosaurs can wait. Community Helpers can wait. Today’s Weather can wait. The most important thing a preschooler can learn, today and every day, is how to be a successful social creature. How to make a friend, be a friend and keep a friend should be front and center in any preschool curriculum. Being able to navigate a conflict—expressing one’s wants and needs and working hard to negotiate a solution—is the social skill of a lifetime.

We will be talking a lot in this book about mediation. Mediations are mini-meetings in which teachers help children work to solve their own disputes. When you are acting as a mediator you don’t take sides, hand down a decision, or offer advice. (That would be arbitrating.) Instead, you ask great questions that help the two conflict partners work things out as independently as possible. Because the young child is just beginning to build a vocabulary, you might have to suggest the names for emotions: “It sounds like that made you sad/angry/frustrated.” In this way, you are providing the building blocks for expressing their feelings.

We will also be talking a lot about play-based curriculum. We think this kind of child development program is best, not only because it is the richest environment for social learning, but also because we know that it is where young children thrive. However, if you find yourself working in a program that is more structured, that doesn’t mean mediation isn’t for you. All the techniques in this book can be put to good use in any kind of school setting. For example, even very structured programs have outdoor play time, and that’s a great place to introduce mediation. Just because you’re not in a play-based program doesn’t mean you can’t become a master mediator!

In this book, we use the term peacemaking to describe a mediation-rich curriculum set in a play-based program. In other words, mediation is a technique, play-based describes a type of program, and when we say peacemaking, we are referring to a teaching practice that embraces both.
