<div class="book-intro-widget">
Conflict is natural in any setting, including preschools, and shouldn’t be seen as misbehavior. Instead, conflict is an opportunity for children to build social skills through creative problem-solving with guidance from teachers. Rather than acting as arbitrators who impose solutions, teachers should mediate—helping children express their feelings and work out disagreements themselves. This teaches children valuable skills like negotiation, patience, and emotional expression. True learning in preschool centers around becoming socially capable, not just academic topics. Mediation, as part of either play-based or structured programs, is essential to fostering a social, cooperative classroom where children learn to navigate and resolve conflicts together.
