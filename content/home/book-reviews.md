  <blockquote>Peacemaking with Preschoolers reminds us of what children really need to thrive—learning environments that nurture healthy human relationships, prioritize hands-on creative play, and provide opportunities to acquire essential, life-long skills for peacefully resolving conflict. An important read for early childhood teachers, administrators, and policy makers.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Peacemaking with Preschoolers challenges popular myths about young children’s conflicts... It explores the over-emphasis on academic training and demonstrates the merits of play-based learning in which everyday disagreements are turned into valuable opportunities for promoting interpersonal maturity and mutual understanding. The practical guidelines contained in this volume cleverly and evocatively move us beyond Montessori, Froebel, Erikson, and Piaget to a fresh, new grasp of preschool as a developmental phase in its own right.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>In today’s fast-paced, screen-saturated world, children have fewer chances to engage in the kind of spontaneous, imaginative play that builds emotional resilience and social skills. Peacemaking with Preschoolers offers a powerful, practical guide to helping young children navigate conflict through play-based learning... Whether you're a parent, teacher, or caregiver, this must-read resource will transform how you support preschoolers in becoming confident, compassionate problem-solvers.</blockquote>
