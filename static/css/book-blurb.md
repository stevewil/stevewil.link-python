Conflicts in the classroom and on the playground pose a relentless challenge for teachers of young children. But these very same conflicts provide vivid, teachable moments to help advance children’s social-emotional learning, emotional regulation, self-advocacy, and empathy for peers. Mediation is the key – and it’s something not usually taught in teacher education programs.

*Peacemaking with Preschoolers* helps teachers learn effective, practical techniques for mediating children’s disputes. The authors provide readers with a theoretical framework – both psychological and developmental—for understanding children’s conflicts. Then they get right to the heart of the matter with scripts of actual disputes, allowing the reader a “you are there” opportunity to witness skilled teachers dealing with conflict right in the moment.

This book is built on two pillars: children need ample time for free play, and teachers need tools for handling conflicts that naturally occur. The conflicts that are bound to happen when children play with gusto and imagination are fertile ground for social and emotional learning—not an unwelcome distraction from the preschool curriculum. In short, *Peacemaking with Preschoolers* presents a design for classrooms where the best of what teachers have to offer in the way of mediation brings out the best of what children can learn in the way of social and emotional mastery.
